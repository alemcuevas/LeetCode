All the problems I've solved from https://leetcode.com

Friendly reminder to use this as a last resource, always try to work the problem on your own first.

Concepts that are used over the different coding exercises.

### Arrays

You know the address for every item in the array. 
Arrays start at index zero.
Reading O(1)
Insertion O(n)
Deletion O(n)

### Linked Lists

Useful if you want to insert or delete an elements in the middle.
Each item stores the address of the next item in the list.
O(n) time means you touch every element in the list once.
Reading O(n)
Insertion O(1)
Deletion O(1)

### Stacks

### Queues

### Selection sort

To find the highest value you have to check each item in the list. This takes O(n) time and you have to do that n times.
This takes O(n x n) or O(n^2)

### Quicksort

Faster than Selection Sort, it only takes O(n log n)

### Recursion
